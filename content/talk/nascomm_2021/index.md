summary: NASSCOM-The NLP Week- The session helped developers comprehend the workflow associated with the development of Speech to Speech Machine Translation models. 
abstract: The talk covered Speech To Speech Machine Translation. Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya and Prof. Preethi Jyothi (from IIT Bombay) pioneered the session with a talk on MT and (ASR + TTS) respectively. Jyotsana Khatri, Vineet Bhatt and Nikhil Saini demonstrated Machine Translation, Text To Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition systems with the help of a code walkthrough on Google Colab notebooks. The three components led to the formation of a complete SSMT pipeline for English to Hindi and English to Marathi language translations.
