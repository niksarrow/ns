abstract: The talk convered Speech To Speech Machine Translation. Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya and Prof. Preethi Jyothi pioneered the session with a talk on MT and (ASR + TTS) respectively. Jyotsana Khatri, Vineet Bhatt and I demonstrated Machine Translation, Text To Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition systems by showcasing a code walkthrough on Google Colab notebooks. The three components led to the formation of a complete SSMT pipeline for English to Hindi and English to Marathi language directions.
