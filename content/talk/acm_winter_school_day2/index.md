abstract: The talk covered Disfluency Correction in the context of Speech to Speech Machine Translation. Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Aakash Banerjee and I convered the different paradigms of Machine Translation. I talked on two tasks, the first being "Translation from Disfluent Spanish To Fluent English", which is an accepted work at ACL 2020 and the second being "Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Learning for Disfluency Correction" which will be published in EACL 2021.
