Welcome 👋 Let's sit for a ☕️ and discuss anything interesting.

I'm Nikhil Saini, a Lead Engineer in the Language AI Team at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research Institute Bangalore</a>. 
My research interests include AI/ML 🤖 applied on Natural Language. Currently, researching on Generative AI (LLMs) applied to natural language. Some of these are around Data generation (using Prompt Engineering), LLM Finetuning (LoRA), Model Compression 🗜 (QLorA, GPTQ ...), Model Selection, Evaluation, Ondevice execution of LLMs (Tflite), and for more let's get in touch 😉

~Past 🔙:
I've worked at <a href="http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/">CFILT</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/">CSALT</a> lab with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/">Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/">Prof. Preethi Jyothi</a> on problems involving Speech and NLP during post-graduation 👨‍🎓.
