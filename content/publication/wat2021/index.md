abstract: Multilingual Neural Machine Translation hasachieved remarkable performance by traininga  single  translation  model  for  multiple  lan-guages.  This paper describes our submission(Team ID- CFILT-IITB) for the MultiIndicMT:An Indic Language Multilingual Task at WAT2021.  We train multilingual NMT systems bysharing encoder and decoder parameters withlanguage embedding associated with each to-ken  in  both  encoder  and  decoder.Further-more,  we  demonstrate  the  use  of  translitera-tion (script conversion) for Indic languages inreducing the lexical gap for training a multilin-gual NMT system. Further, we show improve-ment in performance by training a multilingualNMT system using languages of the same fam-ily, i.e., related languages
